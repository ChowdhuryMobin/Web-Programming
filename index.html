         <li>Cricket</li>
            <dd>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
            (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores
            runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and
            fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either
            wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" target=" ">Read More</a>

            <dd>
               Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played with a spherical ball between
               two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies,
               making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each
               end. The object of the game is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing
               goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" target=" ">Read More</a>

         <li>Table-Tennis</li>
            <dd>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball,
            also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard
            table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball
            played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite
            side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis" target=" ">Read More</a></dd>
